# SUB-IC

Starting with the SCPH-7500 (PU-22), the merging of several chips resulted in a new `IC732` chip for the motherboards, which included:

- [CD-decoder](cddec.md)
- [CD-DSP](cddsp.md)
- [Sound processor (SPU)](spu.md)
- CD-Decoder memory (32 KByte)

This significantly reduced the size of the motherboard and the entire chipset is now located only on the side-A.

There is no name for the IC732, so let's agree to call it simply: `SUB-IC`.
