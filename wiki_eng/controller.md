# Controllers

Controllers (or "joysticks", although JoyStick is a bit different).

Many different input devices were made for the PSX, but the most common were 2 types of controllers: with motors (DualShock) and WITHOUT motors.

The first controller model was motorless.

PSX controllers became an icon of the era in terms of design: boomerang shape and 4 buttons: square, cross, circle and triangle.

Later on, though, the vibromotors with analog sticks made another technical revolution (although I almost never used them myself, it was inconvenient to control, but the roar of the helicopter in Metal Gear Solid was imprinted in my memory forever).
